### The Orville Season One Trading Cards Checklist

This is a gift to The Orville fans who want to keep track of their trading cards collections. The code relies on the graphics resources made online for the Rittenhouse [trading cards checklist](https://www.scifihobby.com/products/checklist.cfm?SetID=348) for the [first season](https://www.scifihobby.com/products/theorville/season_one/) of The Orville.

### Technical information
* The project relies on the Bootstrap and jQuery, both included from external resources.
* The images are sourced from the original website (scifihobby.com) and may become unavailable in the future, but the code will still work and it can be adapted to display the images from a different website.

### Features
1. Each card has a counter that you can change according to the number of your cards, with the counter being saved in the browser's Local Storage[*];
2. The cards are named and grouped in sets named identically to the original checklist;
3. The density of the cards grid can be adjusted for the user's convenience;
4. A drop-down menu allows quick navigation to a particular cards set;
5. The drop-down menu includes a counter for each card that you have in the set (ignoring duplicates), with the counter being updated as you change the count of your individual cards.

[*] The card counters are stored on your PC, in your browser's [Local Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage#Local_and_session_storage), which means the data will be saved in your browser and will persist across restarts. This also means that the counters that you save in a browser are only available to itself, and a different browser will be unable to access them, even on the same PC.

### Feedback
Feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/kneekoo/orville-s1-cards/issues) for any feedback you might have. Keep in mind that this is just a hobby project and I have no intention to dramatically increase its complexity. Smaller features, I'll consider them. :) But as this is an open source project, you're free to take it upon you and improve it exactly as you see fit.

Enjoy! :)
